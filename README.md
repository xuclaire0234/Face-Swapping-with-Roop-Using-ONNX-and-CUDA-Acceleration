# Face-Swapping-with-Roop-Using-ONNX-and-CUDA-Acceleration
This project implements face swapping and enhancement techniques using the `Roop` tool. Roop utilizes ONNX models and CUDA acceleration for efficient real-time face swapping in images and videos. The project also includes optional enhancement of swapped faces for higher-quality results.
