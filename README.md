# Face-Swapping-with-Roop-Using-ONNX-and-CUDA-Acceleration
This project implements face swapping and enhancement techniques using the `Roop` tool. Roop utilizes ONNX models and CUDA acceleration for efficient real-time face swapping in images and videos. The project also includes optional enhancement of swapped faces for higher-quality results.

## 2. Setup and Installation

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Roop Repository**
2. **Install Dependencies**
3. **Download and Configure ONNX Model**
4. **Install CUDA-Optimized PyTorch and ONNX Runtime**

## 3. Running the Face Swapping Process

### Face Swapping on Images
1. Swap a face from the `source` image onto the `target` image using the CUDA execution provider.
2. Save the output as a new image.

### Visualizing Results
- Using OpenCV, display the `source`, `target`, and `output` images side by side for evaluation.

## 4. Advanced Usage: Video Face Swapping

1. Swap faces in a video (`target1.mp4`) using a static `source` image.
2. Save the swapped video as a new file.

### Additional Configuration:
- Use `--temp-frame-quality` and `--output-video-quality` to control the quality of intermediate and output videos.

## 5. Key Concepts and Related Knowledge

### Face Swapping
- **Process:** Replacing the face in a target image/video with a face from the source while maintaining the target's overall structure, pose, and lighting conditions.
- **Applications:** Movie editing, content creation, and augmented reality.

### ONNX Model
- **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange):** A format for representing deep learning models, enabling interoperability between various frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and others.
- **InSwapper Model:** Specially designed for high-quality face-swapping tasks.

### GPU Acceleration
- **CUDA:** NVIDIAâ€™s parallel computing platform that allows leveraging GPUs for intensive computations.
- **Advantages:** GPU acceleration significantly speeds up face-swapping operations, especially for videos.

### Roop Framework
- **Features:**
  - Easy-to-use interface for face swapping.
  - Supports both images and videos.
  - Optional enhancement of swapped faces for better results.

## 7. Challenges and Future Improvements

### Challenges
1. **Complex Poses:** Handling extreme face angles and expressions can occasionally lead to artifacts.
2. **Video Artifacts:** Maintaining consistency across frames in high-motion videos.

### Future Improvements
1. Train or fine-tune models for specific face-swapping tasks to improve accuracy.
2. Integrate additional features like live face swapping in video streams.
3. Experiment with higher-resolution models for enhanced output quality.
